Mindwhipper is an open-source esorectic programming language inspired by Brainfrick. Mindwhipper is currently being ran by jannek123.
Mindwhipper is mostly functional, with the exception of a broken command which was supposed to convert a value in the memory tape into a ASCII character and then print it into the console... you can create a fork though!
If I see a fork of this repo adds some good stuff and possibly fixes some bugs, I'll "merge" the fork into the original repo!
Mindwhipper is written in Visual C++, and ONLY uses the standard library, so the source code is pretty lightweight and easily portable without creating a .zip file.
Currently, running mindwhipper requires you to compile it... but due to the fact that it only uses the standard library, and that it only consists of one source file, it's easy as butter! Trust me.
1. Create a new Visual Studio project.
2. Right-click on your project (NOT the solution) and click "Open in Explorer". You will be in the project's path.
3. Copy the main.cpp file onto the main project folder (again, NOT the solution folder), click "Compile" in Visual Studio and boom! you are running mindwhipper on your own computer.

Documentation on mindwhipper:
-The Memory Tape:
The memory tape is pretty simple. Imagine it as an array of values that you can modify and even print onto the console (because that's literally what it is). The memory tape is 20 elements in size. 
-Command list coming soon! For now, if you need a full list of commands, just DM me on Discord (my name and id is "ButtHat#1658" without quotes) and I might send a list of mindwhipper commands to you.
