Mindwhipper is an open-source esorectic programming language inspired by Brainfrick. Mindwhipper is currently being ran by jannek123
Mindwhipper is mostly functional, with the exception of a broken command which was supposed to convert a value in the memory tape into a ASCII character and then print it into the console... you can create a fork though!
If I see a fork of this repo adds some good stuff and possibly fixes some bugs, I'll "merge" the fork into the original repo!
